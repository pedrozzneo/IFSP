git branch

Definition
-> it represents another layer of organization, I have a goal to do, so I can create a division named after the goal with a copy of what I had up to now. It gives meaning to my commits after moving to that copy/branch as they are related to the name of the branch which is my goal. 

Composition
-> they are simply pointers that refer to the commits, so they are very lightweight, we do not need to worry about storage with them!

Examples
-> Having that level of organization, I could have copies that their content is only the tested and good ones, copies to solve bugs, copies to add features... So basically, depending on my goal, I will bring the set that represents it

Usage
-> git branch {name_of_branch} to create it, git checkout {name_of_branch} to actually work there, another possibility is to just use the command git checkout -b {name_of_branch} that does both things at the same time
