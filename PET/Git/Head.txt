Head

-> Definition:
it tracks our latest changes, by default, it points to the branch of our latest commit, but I can detach it from the branch and attach it to a specific commit

-> Definition:
they represent a way to refer to that branch, one of them is through their id, a long and unique code! Another way is through relative reference, that is basically a navigation on the tree, it points to parent or children

-> Hashes:
you can see all the commits hash through the command git log, additionally you can use git log --oneline that just tells you a nickname for those branches

-> Relative references:
you can refer to a parent by using the ^ symbol, so lets suppose I'm on main, typing main^ moves main to its first parent, the amount of times i use the ^ symbol repeats the process, once i used this command, now my head is detached and pointing to a commit, then I can use the same navigation but now refereeing to HEAD instead of main
	also we can navigate with the tilde ~{number_of_moves}

-> Forcing branch move:
git branch -f {branch} {reference}, that moves the branch pointer to the reference and ignores everything from the reference on, useful for discarding changes

-> Workflow:
basically head points to the latest commit of a branch, thats the natural operation, it follows the recent state, that's why we say it points to the branch itself, detached head just tells us that we are working on a previous version of the branch

Usage:
if I want my HEAD to track a specific commit, then I execute git checkout {name_of_commit}
