git merge

Definition
-> essentially, it combines all the work between 2 branches, I put them together!! When doing so, another commit is automatically made that contains everything

Usage
-> git merge {branch_I_want_to_implement_on_the_current_one}

Examples
-> I'm on branch main and I enter: git merge bugfix, now main will commit this new content and move its pointer to there, if I go to bugfix and merge with main, I already have the result saved in the tree, so I just need to move my pointer there, its the same commit
