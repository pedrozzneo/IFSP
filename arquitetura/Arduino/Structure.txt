Structure

-> USB port: connects Arduino to pc, data can then be transferred
-> USB to serial chip: is what translates code/data between pc and Arduino
-> Microcontroller: is the CPU of the Arduino, what process instructions and handles data
-> Digital pins: can transmit 0 or 1 values as its 1 bit (on/off)
-> Analog pins: can transmit 0 to 1023 values as its 10 bits
-> 5v/3.3v: they are used to power external components
-> GND: short for ground, its what completes the circuit to a different point
-> VIN: short for Voltage In, you can connect power supplies
